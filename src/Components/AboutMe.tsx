                                    Hello! My name is Leighton Miguel, I am currently 19 years old,
                                    my favorite color is mint green, and I love technology! I am
                                    from a homey and lush town called Mililani which is on the
                                    island of Oahu and a part of the beautiful state of Hawaii. I
                                    grew up playing tennis, traveling frequently, playing video
                                    games and building computers. I have been
                                    surrounded by computers and technology for all of my early life
                                    as my dad built his own computers as a side hobby. My upbringing
                                    in a loving family with a love for computers has fostered my
                                    deep appreciation for them and shaped my desire to further my
                                    skills in programming!
                                </p>
                                
                                
                                <p id="aboutmep2">
                                    
                                    My love for Hawaii as a home and as a place ultimately helped me
                                    decide to attend the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and with my
                                    love for technology and computers, it was a no brainer for me to
                                    major in Computer Science. At the time of writing this, I am currently a sophomore and
                                    anticipated to graduate in the Spring of
                                    2026. I happily look forward to the adventures I know will
                                    come my way!
